# Beginner Tutorial
> Training your first Deep Learning model with the OpenMined plaftorm

All the tutorials are written in a Jupyter Notebook and you can find them on [OpenMined/tutorials/beginner](https://github.com/OpenMined/tutorials/tree/master/beginner).
But before start any of them, you need to do this steps first:

1. Complete our [OSX](https://github.com/OpenMined/tutorials/blob/master/installation/OpenMined/OSX.markdown), [Linux](https://github.com/OpenMined/tutorials/blob/master/installation/OpenMined/ubuntu.markdown) or [Windows](https://github.com/OpenMined/tutorials/blob/master/installation/OpenMined/Windows.markdown) installation guide
2. [Fork](https://github.com/OpenMined/tutorials#fork-destination-box) and clone this repository into your OpenMined local folder
3. Go to the copied folder `$ cd OpenMined/tutorials`
4. Start Jupyter Notebook Server on this directory by enter `$ jupyter notebook` on the terminal
5. Install Keras library with the command `$ conda install -c conda-forge keras`

You're now ready to star your [first Jupyter Notebook tutorial](https://github.com/OpenMined/tutorials/blob/master/beginner/Keras%20Neural%20Net.ipynb)
